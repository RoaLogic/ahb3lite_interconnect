\section{Global Signals}\label{global-signals}

The common signals are shared between all devices on the AHB bus. The
AHB-Lite Interconnect has master and slave AHB-Lite buses and they all
use the global signals.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lccl@{}}
\toprule
Port & Size & Direction & Description\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\texttt{HRESETn} & 1 & Input & Asynchronous active low reset\tabularnewline
\texttt{HCLK} & 1 & Input & System clock input\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\caption{AMBA3 Global Signals}
\end{longtable}

\subsection{HRESETn}\label{hresetn}

When the active low asynchronous \texttt{HRESETn} input is asserted (`0'), the
core is put into its initial reset state.

\subsection{HCLK}\label{hclk}

\texttt{HCLK} is the system clock. All internal logic operates at the rising edge
of the system clock. All AHB bus timings are related to the rising edge
of \texttt{HCLK}. All master and slave ports must operate at the same \texttt{HCLK} clock.

\section{Master Interface}\label{master-interface}

The master ports are regular AHB3-Lite slave interfaces. All signals are
supported. See the AHB-Lite specifications for a complete description of
the signals. In addition, a custom master priority port is included per interface to enable
prioritisation when multiple masters attempt to simultaneously access the same slave. This
prioritisation may be defined statically or dynamically changed during operation.

The AHB-Lite Multi-layer Interconnect implements 1 or more interfaces to AHB-Lite masters
as defined by the \texttt{MASTERS} parameter. Therefore the following signals are all
arrays reflecting the number of masters supported.

\textbf{Note:} clog\textsubscript{2}() refers to the System Verilog function by
the same name, defined below, and is used to determine the required bitwidth of a
bus required to represent the defined range of values:

\begin{quote}
\emph{The system function \$clog2 shall return the ceiling of the log
base 2 of the argument (the log rounded up to an integer value). The
argument can be an integer or an arbitrary sized vector value. The
argument shall be treated as an unsigned value, and an argument value of
0 shall produce a result of 0.}
\end{quote}

\subsection{mst\_HSEL}\label{mst_hsel}

The master port only responds to other signals on its bus when \texttt{mst\_HSEL} is
asserted (`1'). When \texttt{mst\_HSEL} is negated (`0') the master port
considers the bus IDLE and asserts \texttt{HREADYOUT} (`1').

\subsection{mst\_HTRANS}\label{mst_htrans}

\texttt{mst\_HTRANS} indicates the type of the current transfer. It is driven to
the connected slave.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}clp{9cm}@{}}

parameter. It is driven to the connected slave.

\subsection{mst\_HWDATA}\label{mst_hwdata}

\texttt{mst\_HWDATA} is the write data bus. Its size is determined by the
\texttt{HDATA\_SIZE} parameter. It is driven to the connected slave.

\subsection{mst\_HRDATA}\label{mst_hrdata}

\texttt{mst\_HRDATA} is the read data bus. Its size is determined by \texttt{HDATA\_SIZE}
parameter. The connected slave drives it.

\subsection{mst\_HWRITE}\label{mst_hwrite}

\texttt{mst\_HWRITE} is the read/write signal. \texttt{mst\_HWRITE} asserted (`1') indicates a
write transfer. It is driven to the connected slave.

\subsection{mst\_HSIZE}\label{mst_hsize}

\texttt{mst\_HSIZE} indicates the size of the current transfer. It is driven to
the connected slave.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccl@{}}

\subsection{mst\_HBURST}\label{mst_hburst}

The burst type indicates if the transfer is a single transfer or part of
a burst. It is driven to the connected slave.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccl@{}}

\midrule
\endhead

\subsection{mst\_HPROT}\label{mst_hprot}

The protection signals provide information about the bus transfer. They
are intended to implement some level of protection. It is driven to the
connected slave.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccl@{}}
\toprule
Bit \# & Value & Description\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead

& 0 & User access\tabularnewline
0 & 1 & Data access\tabularnewline
& 0 & Opcode fetch\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\caption{Protection Signals (HPROT)}
\end{longtable}

\subsection{mst\_HREADYOUT}\label{mst_hreadyout}

When a slave is addressed, the \texttt{mst\_HREADYOUT} indicates that the
addressed slave finished the current transfer. The Interconnect IP
routes the addressed slave's \texttt{HREADY} signal to the master.

When no slave is addressed, the \texttt{mst\_HREADYOUT} signal is generated
locally, inside the Interconnect.

\subsection{mst\_HMASTLOCK}\label{mst_hmastlock}

The master lock signal indicates if the current transfer is part of a
locked sequence, commonly used for Read-Modify-Write cycles. While the
\texttt{mst\_HMASTLOCK} is asserted, the Interconnect IP cannot switch the
addressed slave to another master, even if that master has a higher
priority. Instead the current master retains access to slave until it
releases \texttt{mst\_HMASTLOCK}.

\subsection{mst\_HREADY}\label{mst_hready}

\texttt{mst\_HREADY} indicates the status of the local \texttt{HREADY} on the master's
local bus. It is routed to the \texttt{HREADYOUT} port of the connected slave.

\subsection{mst\_HRESP}\label{mst_hresp}

\texttt{mst\_HRESP} is the transfer response from the connected slave, it can
either be OKAY (`0') or ERROR (`1'). The Interconnect IP routes the
connected slave's \texttt{HRESP} port to \texttt{mst\_HRESP}.

\subsection{mst\_priority}\label{mst_priority}

\texttt{mst\_priority} is a custom port per master interface and defines the priority
of the attached master. The width of the bus is calculated as clog\textsubscript{2}(\texttt{MASTERS}), with the lowest priority value defined as 0 and the  highest priority being \texttt{MASTERS-1}.

For example, for a system with 4 masters the width of \texttt{mst\_priority} will be
2 bits to enable each master to have a unique prioritisation level, with lowest priority being 0 and highest priority being 3.

\section{Slave Interface}\label{slave-interface}

The slave ports are regular AHB-Lite master interfaces.. All signals are
supported. In addition each slave port has a non-standard
\texttt{slv\_HREADYOUT}. See the AHB-Lite specifications for a complete
description of the signals.

The AHB-Lite Multi-layer Interconnect implements 1 or more interfaces to AHB-Lite slaves
as defined by the \texttt{SLAVES} parameter. Therefore the following signals are all
arrays reflecting the number of slaves supported.

\subsection{slv\_addr\_base}\label{slv_addr_base}

\texttt{slv\_addr\_base} is a \texttt{SLAVES} sized array of addresses, each
\texttt{HADDR\_SIZE} bits wide, defining the base address of each attached slave device.

\subsection{slv\_addr\_mask}\label{slv_addr_mask}
\texttt{slv\_addr\_mask} is a \texttt{SLAVES} sized array of \texttt{HADDR\_SIZE} bit wide
signals. Each \texttt{slv\_addr\_base} address is masked with the corresponding
\texttt{slv\_addr\_mask} value to define the addressable memory space of the attached slave.
Setting a bit of \texttt{slv\_addr\_mask} to '0' enables the corresponding address bit.

\subsection{slv\_HSEL}\label{slv_hsel}

connected master drives \texttt{slv\_MASTLOCK}.

\subsection{slv\_HREADYOUT}\label{slv_hreadyout}

The \texttt{slv\_HREADYOUT} signal reflects the state of the connected master
port's \texttt{HREADY} port. It is provided to support local slaves connected
directly to the master's AHB-Lite bus. It is driven by the connected
master's \texttt{HREADY} port.

\textbf{Note:} \texttt{slv\_HREADYOUT} is not an AHB-Lite Signal.

\subsection{slv\_HREADY}\label{slv_hready}

\texttt{slv\_HREADY} indicates whether the addressed slave is ready to transfer
data or not. When \texttt{slv\_HREADY} is negated (`0') the slave is not ready,
forcing wait states. When \texttt{slv\_HREADY} is asserted (`0') the slave is
