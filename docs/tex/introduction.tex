\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The Roa Logic AHB-Lite Multi-layer Interconnect is a fully parameterized
soft IP High Performance, Low Latency Interconnect Fabric for AHB-Lite.
It allows a virtually unlimited number of AHB-Lite Bus Masters and
Slaves to be connected without the need of bus arbitration to be
implemented by the Bus Masters. Instead, Slave Side Arbitration is
implemented for each Slave Port within the core.

The Multi-layer Interconnect supports priority based and Round-Robin based
arbitration when multiple Bus Masters request access to the same Slave
Port. Typically arbitration completes within 1 clock cycle.
